my rust text editor a project inspired by a "build your x" way of practicing and learning by implementing existing tools and technologies.

For this project I am planning to follow this tutorial/course: https://philippflenker.com/hecto/ but I am planning to add my flavor to eventually replace nano/micro/vim I use on my linux because none of them do what I need them to do. Hopefully I will make something like micro but able to run both in terminal and as a seperate app with custom highlighting for my needs.
