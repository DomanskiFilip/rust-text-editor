my rust text editor a project inspired by a "build your x" way of practicing and learning by implementing existing tools and technologies.

For this project I am planning to eventually replace nano/micro/vim I use on my linux because none of them do what I need them to do.
Hopefully I will make something like micro but able to run both in terminal and as a seperate app with custom highlighting for my needs.

progress update: with tabs management integrated I can say the tui is finished, it still doesnt have highlighting but it basicaly works like micro right now. With that beeing said I will now move on to building gui that will be accesible normaly or through terminal with quick --gui / quick (path) --gui. The highliting based on file extentions will be done either after gui or during building gui.
