my rust text editor a project inspired by a "build your x" way of practicing and learning by implementing existing tools and technologies.

For this project I am planning to eventually replace nano/micro/vim I use on my linux because none of them do what I need them to do.
Hopefully I will make something like micro but able to run both in terminal and as a seperate app with custom highlighting for my needs.

progress update: highlighting and graphemes handling implemented the tui is officially in its 1.0 version now I just need to get gui to that point and all will be done
